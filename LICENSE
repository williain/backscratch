Do what you will with this, I don't really care.  Use at your own risk - if you choose to download this and run it, and it writes over something you care about or coincidentally some hardware fails, it's your choice to do so, and nothing I write here or elsewhere will be interpreted as a guarantee that you won't incur some intellectual or monetary loss.

But if you do end up using it, raise an issue to say hi or something!
